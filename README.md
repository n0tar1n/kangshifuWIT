# ConnectAble

ConnectAble helps MRT service staff communicate smoothly with people who have hearing, speech, or visual impairments by adapting the conversation mode to the user’s needs.

For this hackathon build, we focus mainly on supporting **hearing and speech impairments**. The partner can use sign/gesture input to express their intent, and the app converts it into clear text so staff can respond quickly and accurately.

## Run the hand sign detection model
```bash
conda activate mrt-sign
python -m streamlit run ui.py


## Run the frontend
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
